        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>
          By accessing or using CanScan (the "App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service and all applicable laws and regulations. If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing the App. The materials contained in this App are protected by applicable copyright and trademark law.
        </p>
        
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">2. Use License</h2>
        <p>
          Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials on CanScan's App for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-4">
          <li>Modify or copy the materials;</li>
          <li>Use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display;</li>
          <li>Attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on CanScan's App;</li>
          <li>Remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or</li>
          <li>Transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-4">
          This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by CanScan at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.
        </p>
        
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">3. Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
          The materials on CanScan's App are provided on an 'as is' basis. CanScan makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Further, CanScan does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials on its App or otherwise relating to such materials or on any sites linked to this App.
        </p>
        
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">4. Product Identification</h2>
        <p>
          CanScan attempts to accurately identify Canadian products through barcode scanning and image recognition technology. However, we cannot guarantee 100% accuracy in all cases. The identification results provided by the App should be used as a guide only and not as definitive product information.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Users are encouraged to verify product information through official product packaging or manufacturer websites when making important purchasing decisions.
        </p>
        
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">5. Limitations</h2>
        <p>
          In no event shall CanScan or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on CanScan's App, even if CanScan or a CanScan authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.
        </p>
        
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">6. Accuracy of Materials</h2>

CanScan does not warrant that any of the materials on its App are accurate, complete, or current. CanScan may make changes to the materials contained on its App at any time without notice.
